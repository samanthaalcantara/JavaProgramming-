#KeyWords

Programming:
Means to create(develop) software, which is
also called a program. Software contains the instructions 
that tell a computer or a computerized device what to do.

Computer:
An electronic Devie that stores and processes data.
A computer includes both harware and software. Hardware
compromise the visible, physical elements of the computer
and software provides the invisible instructions that control
the hardware and make it perfom specific tasks.
-A central processing uni (CPU)
-Memory(main memory)
-Storage Devices(such as disks and CDs)
-Input Devices(such as the mouse and keyboard)
-Output Devices(such as monitors and printers)
-Communication Devices(such as modems and network 
interface cards)

Motherboard: 
Is a bus that is built into the computer's motherboard, 
which is a circuit case that connects all of the computer
together.


CPU/Central Processing Unit:
Is the computer's brain. It retrieves instructions
from memory and executes them.CPU has two components
a control unit and a arithmetic/logic unit.


Speed: 
Every computer has an enternal clock, that emits
electronic pulses at a constant rate. A higher clock
speed enables more instructions to be executed in a 
given period of time.

Hertz(Hz):
Is the measurement of clock speed.
1 hertz equals to 1 pulse per second.

Megahertz(MHz):
1990's compyters measured the clock speed in MHz.

Gigahertz(GHz):
This is the fastest CPU speed.

Core:
Is the part of the processor that performs the reading
and executing of instructions. In order to increase
CPU processing power, chip manufacturers are now 
producing CPU's that contain multiple cores.

Bit: 
Digits in the binary number system are called
bits.
 
Byte:
The minimum storage unit in a computer is a byte.
A byte is composed of eight bits.

Encoding Scheme:
Is a set of rules that govern how a computer translates
characters, numbers, and symbols into data the computer
can actually work with.

Kilobyte(KB): 1,000 Bytes
Megabyte(MB): 1 Million Bytes
Gigabyte(GB): 1 Billion Bytes
Terabyte(TB): 1 Trillion Bytes

Memory:
Consists of an ordered sequence of bytes for storing 
programs as well as data that the program is working
with.

Unique Address: 
The address is used to locate the byte for storing and
retrieving the data.

RAM:
Memory is also referred to as Random-Access Memory.
Today's computers usually have 4 gigabytes of RAM,
but more commonly have 6 to 8  GB installed. The more
RAM a computer has, the faster the computer will operate.

Storage Devices:
Programs and data are permanently stored on storage
devices and are moved when the computer uses them,
to memory. THree types of main storage devices are.
-Magnetic Disk Drives
-Optical Disc Drives (CD and DVD)
-USB Flash Drives
^To store physical data
 

Disks: 
Computers usually have 1 hard disk drive, they are
used for permanently storing data and programs. New
computers can store 500 GB to one TB of data. Hardisks
can be inside a computer or externally.


CDs:
Compact Disk
CD-R(Read Only)Only Readable
CD-RW (Rewrite)_You can add information

DVDs: 
Digital versatile disco or digital video disc.

USB Flash Drives:
Universal Serial Bus
External Flash Drive for storing Data

Mouse:
Point Device, triggers to perform an action.

The monitor:
Displays information, (text, graphics)


Pixels:
Screen Resolution

Dot Pitch:
The amount of space between pixels measured in millimeters.



#Questions:

1.1 What are hardware and software?
Hardware is the physical elements of the computer
and Software provides the invisible instructions
that control the hardware and make it perform
specific tasks.

1.2 List five major hardware components of a computer.
-A central processing uni (CPU)
-Memory(main memory)
-Storage Devices(such as disks and CDs)
-Input Devices(such as the mouse and keyboard)
-Output Devices(such as monitors and printers)
-Communication Devices(such as modems and network 
interface cards)

1.3 What does the acronym "CPU" stand for?
Central Processing Unit

1.4 What Unit is used to measure the CPU speed?
Hz, MHz, GHz

1.5 What is a bit? What is a Byte?
A Bit is Digits in the binary number system are called
bits.

A Byte is the minimum storage unit in a computer is a byte.
A byte is composed of eight bits. 


1.6 What is memory for? What does RAM stand for? Why 
is memory called RAM?

Memory is for storing data, RAM stands for Random-Access Memory.
Memory is called RAM because it can be accessed in any order.

1.7 What is used to measure memory size?
KB
MB
GB
TB

1.8 What Unit is used to measure disk size?
Bytes

1.9 What is the primary difference between memory and a storage device? 
Memory refers to the location of short-term data, storage is the component 
of your computer that allows you to store and access data on a long-term basis.
Usually, storage comes in the form of a solid-state drive or a hard drive.

1.10 What language does the CPU understand?
Assembly Language

1.11 What is an assembly language?
 An assembly language is a programming language that can be used to directly tell the computer what to do


1.12 What is an assembler?
Is used to translate assembly-language programs into machine code.

1.13 What is a high-level programming language?
It is a new generation of programming languages.

1.14 What is a source program?
A Source Program written in a language other than machine code,
typically a high-level language.


1.15 What is an interpreter?
An interpreter reads one statement from the source code,
translates it to machine code or virtual machine code, and
then executes it right away.


1.16 What is a complier?
A complier translates the entire source code into a machine code.

1.17 what is the difference between an interpreted language and a compiled
language?
A compiled language is a programming language whose implementations are
typically compilers and not interpreters. An interpreted language is a
programming language whose implementations execute instructions
directly and freely, without previously compiling a program into machine-language instructions.

1.18 What is an operating system? List some popular operating systems.
An operating system is the software that supports a computer's basic
functions, such as scheduling tasks, executing applications, and controlling peripherals.

1.19 What are the major responsibilites of an operating system?
-Hiding the complexities of hardware from the user.
-Managing between the hardware's resources which include the processors, memory, data storage and I/O devices.
-Handling "interrupts" generated by the I/O controllers.
-Sharing of I/O between many programs using the CPU

1.20 What are multiprogramming, multithreading, and multiprocessing?
-Multiprogramming: A computer running more than one program at a time 
-Multiprocessing:  A computer using more than one CPU at a time.
-Multitasking: Tasks sharing a common resource

1.21 Who invented Java? Which company owns Java now?
James Gosling
Oracle Corporation

1.22 What is a Java applet?

An applet is a Java program that runs in a Web browser. An applet can 
be a fully functional Java application because it has the entire
Java API at its disposal. ... A main() method is not invoked on an applet,
and an applet class will not define main(). Applets are designed
to be embedded within an HTML page

1.23 What programming language does Android use?
Java

1.24 What is the Java language specification?
Is a technical definition of the Java programming languages
syntac and semantics.

1.25 What does JDK stand for?
Java Development Toolkit

1.26 What does IDE stand for?
Integrated Development Environment

1.27 Are tools like NetBeans and Eclipse different languages
from Java, or are they dialects or extensions of Java?

-They are Java Development Tools
